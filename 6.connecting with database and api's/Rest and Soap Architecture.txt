___________________________

Rest Architecture--
  
Based on web architecture, web transition , web api.
http protocol ke jriye ham -- put , get , post , delete karte h

Degined for communication between application and web.

known for its simplicity(easy to develop),scalability,flexibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Soap Architecture--

Based on xml (extended markup language).

follow messaging protocol. 
means data ko transfer karna , data ko lana , data ko communicate karna sab xml ke through hoga.

xml is like a file system , or markup language.(here we write commands and it works based on it).

Internally xml use WSDL(web service description language), here we write all the instructions ,and with the help of this soap architecture work.

soap also support http , smtp(simple mail transfer protocol),tcp/ip(transmission control protocol).

In terms of implementation soap is kind of complex.
